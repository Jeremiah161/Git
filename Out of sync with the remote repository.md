This error occurs because your local **main** branch is out of sync with the remote repository. To fix this, follow these steps:

---

### **Step 1: Fetch and Merge Remote Changes**
First, fetch the latest changes from the remote repository:
```sh
git fetch origin
```
Then, merge the changes into your local branch:
```sh
git merge origin/main
```
If there are no conflicts, you can now push:
```sh
git push -u origin main
```
---

### **Step 2: If There Are Conflicts**
If Git reports merge conflicts, you need to manually resolve them. Open the conflicting files, make necessary changes, and then:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
git push -u origin main
```

---

### **Step 3: If You Want to Overwrite Remote Changes (Force Push)**
âš  **Use this only if you are sure that your local changes should replace remote changes.** This will overwrite the remote repository and **delete** any remote updates.

```sh
git push -u origin main --force
```

---

### **Best Practice: Use Rebase Instead of Merge**
Instead of merging, you can **rebase** to keep a clean commit history:

```sh
git pull --rebase origin main
git push -u origin main
```

---

### **Final Notes**
- If you need to preserve **both your local and remote changes**, use **merge**.
- If you want a **cleaner history**, use **rebase**.
- If you're sure your local changes should overwrite remote changes, use **force push**.
